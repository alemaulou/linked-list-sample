## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, students will be able to build a Linked List class along with several of it's key methods with Python. 

Students will also practice creating Unit Tests for the Linked List instance methods that they build.

## Students should be able to...
1. Implement various Linked List methods effectively, including:

  * **size** (returns how many elements exist within the Linked List)
  * **prepend** (add to beginning of list)
  * **append** (add element to end of a list)
  * **insert** (add element to a specific index of list)
  * **search** (search for value in list, if present, return ```True```)
  * **remove** (search for value in list, if present, remove, else, return ```None```)
  * **clear** (clear all elements within list)

2. Write and run unit tests to ensure that methods are working properly.


## Module Goals
1. To better understand the inner mechanics of Python Lists, and how data structures are implemented by building a Linked List from scratch.
2. To practice working with Linked Lists for technical interviews. Students should expect to be be quizzed about Linked Lists and other Abstract Data Types during coding interviews.
3. To build valuable unit testing skills so that students can better maintain their code by reducing bugs when implementing or changing class functionality.

## Assignment
1. **See:** Sketch (pencil and paper!), or utilize [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/list?slide=1) or [USF's](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/) Linked List data structure visualization tools to create a Linked List diagram and submit it in the ``/imgs`` folder of your ``linked-list`` challenge assignment repo.
2. **Build:** Implement all methods for the Linked List class given in the [starter code](https://github.com/alemaulou/linked-list-sample/blob/master/linked-list/linkedlist.py) in the linked-list directory.
3. **Test:** Finish building unit test cases from [starter code](https://github.com/alemaulou/linked-list-sample/blob/master/linked-list/linkedlist_test.py) and create at least **2** of your own.

## Further Challenges
1. Implement more LinkedList methods (see Java Linked List documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html).
2. Create a Stack class using the Linked List data structure you built.
3. Pick a few questions from the [Top 20 Linked List Coding Interview Problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/), and bring them to advisory groups on Wednesday to practice with the class!
