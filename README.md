# Linked Lists

## Slides
Please follow along with the interactive Pear Deck Slides during asynchronous class time, and review with Google Slides after class or if you are absent. 


**Synchronous Class Time**: [Pear Deck](https://app.peardeck.com/student/trhjjwzje)
**Asynchronous Review**: [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G7H4HC7RLqc4k3gYu5aq_Kj8PtOPntoF3wUiiqiajlI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Outcome
By the end of this module, students will be able to build a Linked List class along with several of it's key operations with Python. 

Students will also practice creating Unit Tests for the Linked List instance methods that they build.

## Students should be able to...
Implement various Linked List methods effectively, including:

* **size** (returns how many elements exist within the Linked List)
* **prepend** (add to beginning of list)
* **append** (add element to end of a list)
* **insert** (add element to a specific index of list)
* **search** (search for value in list, if present, return ```True```)
* **remove** (search for value in list, if present, remove, else, return ```None```)
* **clear** (clear all elements within list)


## Module Goals
* To better understand the inner mechanics of Python Lists, and how data structures are implemented, by building a Linked List from scratch.
* To practice working with Linked Lists for technical interviews. Students should expect to be be quizzed about Linked Lists and other Abstract Data Types during coding interviews.
* To build valuable unit testing skills so that students can better maintain their code by reducing bugs when implementing or changing class functionality.

## Assignment
1. **See:** Sketch (pencil and paper!), or utilize [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/list?slide=1) or [USF's](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/) Linked List data structure visualization tools to create a Linked List diagram and submit it in the ``/imgs`` folder of your ``linked-list`` challenge assignment repo.
2. **Build:** Implement all methods for the Linked List class given in the starter code.
3. **Test:** Finish building unit test cases from starter code and create at least **2** of your own.

## Further Challenges
1. Implement more LinkedList methods (see Java Linked List documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html).
2. Create a Stack class using the Linked List data structure you built.
3. Pick a few questions from the [Top 20 Linked List Coding Interview Problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/), and bring them to advisory groups on Wednesday to practice with the class!
