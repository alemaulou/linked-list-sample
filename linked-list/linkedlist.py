'''
A Linked List is a data structure compased by a chain of Node objects.
Each Node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the chain.
Python does not ship a built-in Linked List data structure like Java.
It is your job to implement a Linked List class along with key operations.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        '''
        Initialize node with empty reference field.
        '''
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

    def __repr__(self):
        '''
        To print to console.
        '''
        return self.data

    
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        '''

Challenges:
    1) Implement more LinkedList methods (see Java Linked List documentation here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html)
    2) Implement a Stack class using the Linked List data structure you built.
